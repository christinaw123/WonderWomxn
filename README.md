🏷️ Overview:

This project implements a Mixed Reality (MR) rehabilitation system targeting pediatric physical therapy. 
Designed for the Meta Quest 3, the system leverages passthrough technology and hand-tracking capabilities to gamify therapeutic exercises. 
The solution integrates real-world physical therapy movements into immersive virtual carnival games, with a focus on improving compliance and tracking 
progress through data-driven metrics.

🎯 Features:

Multi-Level Carnival Games

1. Skee-Ball: Simulates rolling balls into virtual targets with accurate physics.
2. Ring Toss: Implements realistic throw mechanics using tracked hand motions.
3. Darts: Calculates projectile trajectories based on velocity, angle, and hand release.
