Rehab Quest: Quest Your Way to Recovery
A Mixed Reality platform providing personalized and adaptive physical and cognitive therapy through gamified experiences.
Problem
3.5 million children like Felix struggle with physical therapy motivation, making recovery harder and more frustrating for both children and parents. Traditional therapy methods often fail to engage young patients, leading to poor adherence to home exercises.
Solution

Gamified, progressively difficult exercises with rewards
Phantom limb therapy through MR gaming
Cognitive behavioral therapy for overcoming fears
Mental wellness and memory rehabilitation exercises
